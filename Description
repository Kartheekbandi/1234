I divided the functionality into several functions that were each in charge of carrying out a single duty when I was writing the code because I believed it was crucial to make the program simple to test. Since each function can now be tested independently, it is simpler to make sure that they all perform as intended before going on to the next.
I made sure that the get user repo commits() function outputs a list of dictionaries with the repository name and number of commits so that the output can be easily validated. This makes it simple to test the software. I also ensured that the main method provides error handling in case an exception arises while the get user repo commits() function is being used.
The GitHub API has rate constraints, which can result in the application failing if too many queries are made quickly, which was one difficulty I encountered when testing this assignment. In order to fix this, I included error handling in the event that the API returns a 403 error (which denotes that the rate limit has been exceeded), and I gave the user explicit feedback in such a circumstance.
